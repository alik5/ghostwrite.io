Hello <%= @letter.properties["company"] %>

Iâ€™m interested in the <%= @letter.properties["position"] %> position. I heard about the position <%= @letter.properties["origin"] %> and think my past experience as <%= @letter.properties["last_job"] %>  makes me a great candidate. 

I am <%= @letter.properties["one_word"] %>, and very interested in learning more about <%= @letter.properties["company"] %> and what I can contribute as <%= @letter.properties["position"] %>. I look forward to speaking with you. 

Thank you,
