		<br>
		I am <%= @letter.properties["one_word"] %>, and very excited about<%= @letter.properties["company"] %>and what I can contribute as <%= @letter.properties["position"] %>.  
		<br>
		<br>

		I look forward to learning more about the position. I will follow up next week to confirm you've received my application.
